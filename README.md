# Advent of Code 2024

My answers to the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles. This year I decided to solve them all in Rust, using a single crate so that each solution can share helper functions and reduce boilerplate.

As per usual, the code I write to solve puzzles is not quite to the standard that I would hold myself to for a real-world project (e.g. lack of commenting, excessive use of globals, lack of modularity).
